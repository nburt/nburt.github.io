        <h2>How I Work</h2>
        <p>
            I work with small to medium-sized companies to generate new business or streamline existing operations. I
            have experience building backend, frontend, and IoT applications from the ground up, as
            well as leading product strategy across software and hardware engineering teams.
        </p>
        <p>
            With experience in operations, I always focus on understanding your business objectives before
            identifying the technology strategy. Trust and communication are important and I won't ever pitch you on
            a solution I don't believe your business needs. If I think you can accomplish your goals with a spreadsheet
            instead of a shiny new website, I'll tell you that.
        </p>
        <p>
            I believe in agile product development, without being dogmatic about it. I write tests, continuously deploy,
            communicate, and incorporate customer feedback every step of the way with my clients to ensure that the
            product we build together solves user needs and moves the needle for your business.

                    I have experience with many languages, frameworks, cloud infrastructure providers, and project
                    management tools. I will work with you to select the right technology stack based on your business
                    needs. I pride myself on learning new technologies quickly and I'm confident in my ability to adapt
                    to your existing stack and create the right solution.

                    I offer a variety of services tailored to your needs. I provide hands-on coding and software
                    development, can work with you to develop a product and technology strategy for your software or
                    hardware product, and have extensive experience developing and conducting technical interviews. As
                    an experienced manager, I also love to coach teams and can help develop future leaders within your
                    engineering organization.
